                <p>
                  Leading Peru Travel was born from a deep passion for sharing the wonders of South America with the world. For over 15 years, we have been crafting all-inclusive luxury packages to Machu Picchu and beyond — creating journeys that go far deeper than typical tourism.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Founded in Cusco, the ancient capital of the Inca Empire, our team of expert local guides and travel designers brings an insider's perspective to every itinerary. We believe that true luxury isn't just about 5-star hotels and first-class trains — it's about authentic connections with the land, the people, and the living culture of Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Ecuador.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What sets us apart is our deep commitment to community-based tourism. We partner directly with indigenous communities, ensuring that tourism becomes a force for positive change — supporting education, preserving traditions, and creating sustainable livelihoods for generations to come.
