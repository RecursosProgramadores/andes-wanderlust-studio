After enjoying a satisfying breakfast at your hotel, your host will accompany you to the Lima airport, where you’ll take a comfortable flight to Cusco, the ancient Imperial Inca City.\n\nYou can watch the Pacific Ocean merge with the blue skies through your plane window, giving way to vast dunes that, in turn, rise and then collapse against the slopes of the towering Andes mountains once conquered many centuries ago by the impressive Inca civilization.\n\nOn your arrival in Cusco, your local host will be waiting for you in the national arrivals area of Cusco Airport, holding a sign with your name. “It’s not altitude sickness… it’s the feeling of being close to heaven,” is a phrase he’ll often say about the altitude. To help you avoid altitude sickness, we’ll head directly from Cusco Airport to the Sacred Valley of the Incas, located 600 meters below Cusco. But please don’t worry you’ll get to enjoy all the wonderful sights of Cusco at the end of your journey, once your body is perfectly acclimatized to the altitude.\n\nOn the way to the Sacred Valley of the Incas we will visit an exceptional Textile House Museum, where you can see the four types of South American camelids raised in captivity: llamas, alpacas, guanacos, and vicuñas. You can feed them and learn how to tell them apart. Local artisans will show you how they use the ancient techniques of their Inca ancestors to transform the delicate fibers of these animals, especially alpacas and vicuñas, into beautiful and colorful garments. You can also see the creation of multicolored belts, finely woven blankets, and exquisitely embroidered textiles. To complete the experience, a guided tour of the museum will immerse you in the fascinating history of pre-Inca cultures and their textile legacy.\n\nThen, we’ll continue descending through the valley slope until we reach a spectacular Inca archaeological site over a hill called Pisac, with magnificent terraced fields on its hill slopes, among Inca enclosures, squares, temples, and even an Inca cemetery! Your first contact with a rich Andean past! Descending into the modern town, we will lose ourselves among the colored stands of the famous Pisac traditional market, where we will be fascinated by its beautiful handicrafts made by local people, like fabric crafts, sculptures, jewelry, and paintings with Andean thematic.\n\nNext, we will visit a charming restaurant nestled in the beautiful landscapes of the Sacred Valley to enjoy a delicious lunch made from local ingredients, all included in your program. You can choose the restaurant in advance, with the advice of your travel consultants.\n\nFinally, we’ll go to your hotel in the middle of the spectacular scenery of the Sacred Valley, and you can enjoy a delicious dinner here, on your own.

By the way, the Maras salt is recognized worldwide as being perfect for grills and barbecues.\n\nMoving on, your guide will transfer up to Moray, where you'll be fascinated by a series of circular terraces, in the form of rings, that go into the earth's deeps. These circular terraces were used as an Incan laboratory to acclimatize crops. They sowed a specific type of seed in each circular terrace, from the smallest and deepest ring to the largest, to see the quality of the harvest they obtained.\n\nFinally, we’ll return to the hotel for a deserved rest, you can take a relaxing shower or, maybe, enjoy a fantastic dinner on your own.\n\n• Overnight in Sacred Valley.\n• Included meals: Breakfast and Lunch."
