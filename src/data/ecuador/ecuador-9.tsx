    description: "Ecuador is far more than the Galápagos Islands, extraordinary wildlife, and the famous equatorial line. Known as the “Country of Four Worlds,” Ecuador is also a land deeply rooted in history, tradition, and cultural richness. This heritage comes beautifully to life in its colonial cities — elegant reminders of its Spanish past — where whitewashed buildings, charming plazas, cobblestone streets, lively traditional markets, and warm, welcoming smiles create an atmosphere that feels both timeless and authentic.\n\nWe invite you to experience these unforgettable sensations as you journey through Ecuador’s most captivating cities: Guayaquil, Cuenca, and Quito.\n\nYour adventure begins in vibrant Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city and gateway to the Pacific. Continue to the colonial gem of Cuenca, often called the “Athens of Ecuador” for its rich intellectual and artistic legacy. Admire its marble façades, magnificent churches, and refined architecture that reflect centuries of cultural splendor. Finally, discover Quito, the Ecuadorian capital and one of the best-preserved colonial cities in South America, where Spanish-style houses, ornate churches, historic squares, and enchanting alleys tell stories of a glorious past.",
